<h1>The Best Movies according to Prisha</h1>
<h2>My top three movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Zindagi Na Milegi Dubara</h3>
<p>A fantastic movie about three friends, who go on a life changing trip. You learn to respect your life and live it instead just survive</p>
<h3>Ye Jawaani Hai Deewani</h3>
<p>Again a movie about friendship, love, life and how they all change over time but the essence remains the same. The movie potrays the importance of relationships.</p>
<h3>Dil Chahta Hai</h3>
<p>Also, a movie about three friends finding love with different perspective, ideologies. This movie breaks superstitions and prejudices with its remarkable cast and screenplay</p>
